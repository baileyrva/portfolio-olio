<b>About</b>

This repository is where I store my most recent projects, contact information, skills, and educational background. 

<b>Installation</b> 

This project is a website designed to be a one stop shop of my work. Feel free to use the sidebar on the side of the page in order to access different representations of my abilities. The goal is to have consistent updates with my most recent projects in order to see my skills develop over the years. 

<b>Credits</b> 

I was the main creator of this portfolio and repository. For help when facing obstacles I constantly lean on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a friend who is a fantastic problem solver.
