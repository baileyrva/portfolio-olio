# portfolio-olio
This repository ("portfolio-olio") is where I (Joe Bailey) develop my portfolio for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. My goal is to create an area for me to store future projects I create individually and with a small team. This will provide different recruiters, companies, instructors, and classmates the opportunity to see my work first hand. 

<b>Installation</b> 

This project is a website designed to be a one stop shop of my work. Feel free to use the headers at the top of the page in order to access different representations of my abilities. 

<b>Credits</b> 

I was the main creator of this portfolio and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver.
