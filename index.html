        <hr>
        <p><img src="./assets/images/RiverSmall.jpg" alt="Huguenot Flatwater">Fullstack Developer with a self-driven
            attitude towards learning new technologies and programming paradigms. Trained and certified at the
            University of Richmond in software engineering, including skills in JavaScript (Node.js/React) and
            associated front-end technologies. Previously taught Algebra skills to middle school students for four
            years, and co-coached a middle school robotics team. I thrive in the process of breaking down an issue to
            its simplest form and building it back up to be more efficient and polished. My ability to quickly solve
            minor code issues paired with the work ethic, durability, and dependability it takes to tackle larger issues
            makes me a tremendous benefit to any team effort.
