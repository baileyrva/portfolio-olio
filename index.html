    <div class="h2"><b>About Me</b>
    <hr>
    <p><img src="./assets/images/RiverSmall.jpg" alt="Huguenot Flatwater">My name is the two largest words on this page besides about me. That's a weird sentence but introductions are hard...so are 
first impressions. Anyway, I have lived in RVA for just over a decade. I moved here when I was 22 and have loved every minute of it.
I truly believe this city will be anything you want it to be. Over the course of my life I have worked many different jobs including but not limited to: 
soccer referee, Food Lion cashier, Arby's Roast Beef Sandwich Artist, Subway Sandwich Artist, and a WaWa Sandwich Artist.
and that was all before I turned 20. One of the many goals in my life is to write a collection of short stories about a character who tries a different job every year from age 16-80. 
If people want to read a story about making different sandwiches at different restaurants I guess I am a soon to be <i>New York Times Bestseller.</i></p>
