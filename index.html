<p>My name is the two largest words on this page besides about me. That's a weird sentence but introductions are hard...so are first impressions. Anyway, I have lived in RVA for just over a decade. I moved here when I was 22 and have loved every minute of it. I truly believe this city will be anything you want it to be. Over the course of my life I have worked many different jobs including but not limited to: <ul><li>Soccer Referee</li><li>Food Lion Cashier</li><li>Arby's Roast Beef Sandwich Artist</li><li>Subway Sandwich Artist</li><li>WaWa Sandwich Artist</li></ul><br> and that was all before I turned 20. One of the many goals in my life is to write a collection of short stories about a character who tries a different job every year from age 16-80. If people want to read a story about making different sandwiches at different restaurants I guess I am a soon to be <i>New York Times Bestseller.</i></p>
